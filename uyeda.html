            <p>
First of all, not listening to you as much as I should have was the worst mistake ever. Iâ€™m sorry for doubting you so much. You are THE GOAT, but I was just too stubborn to realize that (LOL). Honestly, I was terrified of you as I entered Junior year. Especially since I hated the SECA math pathway so much, that damn hole in your wall didnâ€™t help too much eitherâ€¦ ðŸ˜‚Jokes aside, though, Iâ€™m seriously so grateful for everything you have done for me. Thank you for guiding me through college application season and helping me achieve my goal of taking (+ passing!) Calculus 2, and writing some INSANE letters of recommendation that got recognized by both Yale and Harvard. You have been such a fundamental part of my success, and I absolutely cannot thank you enough for it. I used to think your strict and hardgoing nature was bad for a counselor. However, I now see how necessary it is to have a personality and strength like yours to push me and my fellow peers through such difficult academic and personal tribulations. This is one of many things I hope you ever change about how you lead the upper division of SECAâ€™s student body. Aside from that, though, I donâ€™t really know how I could ever thank you enough for what you have done for me. I know you say you didnâ€™t do much, but I literally would not have gotten into Harvard without you. So, thank you for getting me into Harvard. Thank you for listening to my random talks about SECA and beyond. Thank you for pulling me out of class at the most random times without an appointment to help sort out my Delta issues. Thank you for all you do that goes unrecognized by so many students.

    Thank you, Mr. Uyeda.
