            <p>I hope you know how much your guidance has affected me. To be frank with you, I was never the outspoken kid in middle school. I was so anxious and unconfident that I missed my own Promotion Ceremony at the end of my Eighth Grade. My sister, Michayla, being such a social butterfly at SECA, scared me even more. I was terrified as a freshman! With that being sai,d though, I am so glad you pushed me out of my shell. You are literally the catalyst behind all of my leadership and social endeavors throughout high school. Without your support and facilitation of my social development, I assure that I would be an entirely different Michael than who I am today. For that, I thank you. Honestly, I wish I could've expressed my gratitude more throughout my presidency, but I hope you understand why I chose to prioritize other aspects of my life. 

Seriously, though, I hope you know that I truly have learned a thing or two from your Leadership classes these past three years, even if I didn't show it throughout my term. Your unconditional love for your students, your one-of-a-kind ability to personally connect with any student, and engaging methods of teaching are what made you so special to me. Ms. Powell, thank you so much for all you have done for me. Here I will list a few thank yous I owe you. 

Thank you for letting me spend countless hours taking office hours during Lunch for my math class in my Junior year. I would not have passed Precalculus, Calculus 1, or Calculus 2 without your support. 

Thank you for giving me a chance and accepting me into Leadership at the start of my Sophomore year. 

Thank you for dealing with my absenteeism throughout my Senior year. 

Thank you for teaching me how to be critical and truthful while maintaining a level of respect. 

Thank you for always holding me accountable to lead by example. 

Thank you for teaching me how to lead. 

Thank you for making me the leader I am today. 

Thank you for your help in shaping Michael Lin. 

<p>Thank you, Ms. Powell.</p>
