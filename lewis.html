                I’m sure you already know how I feel about how you teach at SECA, but I’ll say it again. You are easily the most talented teacher I’ve met–sincerely. Honestly, I really, really, really was not interested in the social sciences/humanities before Junior year. But as soon as I took your POLSC 5 class in the Fall of my Junior year, everything clicked. I began seeing the social sciences as an extension of my interest in the STEM field. The way you taught us to problem solve international diplomatic issues through logical thinking made me find a hidden love for Government I didn’t realize I had. Your talent in sparking curiosity among uninterested students like me is what makes you special. You were literally so good at sparking this curiosity that I applied to Harvard as a Computer Science + Government double major. You literally changed my life because you made me interested in Government. I cannot thank you enough for that. A few days after I received my acceptance from Harvard, my admissions officer reached out to me and spoke to me about my application. He specifically highlighted how he found the way I articulated my cross-interest in Computer Science and Government to be especially interesting. This cross-interest is thanks to you. So thank you, Mr. Lewis. Thank you for being an amazing teacher. Please never stop changing kids’ lives and keep on teaching the way you teach. It works, it’s interesting, it’s engaging, and out of all the teachers I’ve had, it’s as close as it gets to perfect.
