You have sincerely been such a guide to me. I will always be forever grateful for all the times you have given me endless advice in your office. I think some of the most valuable lessons I learned during my time at SECA were in your office, and they werenâ€™t even academic. The life lessons that you taught me were so valuable, and I will never forget them. Your kindness, listening skills, and life lessons are what set you apart as a counselor. I am so grateful for everything you have taught me and all the times you have spoken to me. Also, thank you so much for allowing me to forge my own academic path at SECA. I am so grateful you believed in my ability to take difficult courses, outside of the SECA norm, and let me change my course schedule around to do so when I asked. It may not seem that important to you, but your belief in me and your letting me take the courses I requested sincerely helped me in my academic journey. I thank you for that. Thank you for everything you have done for me, Mr. Sam. I am truly grateful to you and all that you have done for me.

    Thank you, Mr. Sam.
