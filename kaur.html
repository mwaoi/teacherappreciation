            <p>I cannot thank you enough for being the mom of SECA. Not only have you been at SECA for so many years, but you truly make SECA feel like a family. You welcome students, no matter what math level in your freshman year, and teach them over and over, even if they donâ€™t get it the first time. Your passion for teaching students is evident and I canâ€™t tell you enough how much we, as students, appreciate this. After taking such difficult math classes at Delta, I wish I could go back to 1R Algebra 1 with Kyle, Bryant, and Gurinder in your class. I really loved that class. In the class, I learned one of the most important lessons I have learned at SECA. In that class, you taught me that if you donâ€™t know how to explain something important, then it isnâ€™t important. Whether it was making me show all my work step by step or teaching the class, you constantly taught me that I needed to learn how to explain what I was thinking or else it wasnâ€™t important. I have used this skill in almost every aspect of my life, and especially in my application to Harvard. Thank you for teaching me this skill. Mrs. Kaur, thank you for making my math journey so special. You have done so much more than teach me math, and I cannot thank you enough for that. 
</p>
<p>
    P.S. I will never forget you because I always remember to check my work for silly mistakes when I do math now. ðŸ™‚

<p>
    Thank you, Mrs. Kaur.
