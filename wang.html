            <p>There are so many things I need to thank you for, but first, I should probably commend the most obvious thing you have done for me. Thank you for being the first SECA teacher who challenged me. I always felt like teachers at SECA were too easy on the kids, just a personal opinion, of course, but I know a few other students felt this way. I hated how it felt like getting A’s in classes was easy as long as you did all the work. Sure, it was simple, but that’s not how students learn. Your way of teaching is truly different from that of other teachers at SECA. I think that out of all the teachers at SECA, you most realistically resemble what an aspiring Premed, Engineering, Computer Science, or STEM major might experience in their STEM courses during college. I especially feel this way after taking Calculus 1 and 2. Those classes destroyed me, and studying for your Geometry class showed me what to expect out of a math class. Without your methods of teaching (homework, frequent quizzes, and note checks), there is no way I would’ve done as well as I did in those courses. This is especially true given how little studying most other SECA classes require. If I hadn’t taken your course and learned to study outside of school, going from studying zero hours outside of school for my SECA courses to ten hours per day for my Calculus courses would’ve flipped my brain inside out. So, as strange as it is to hear a student thanking you for assigning homework and tests… THANK YOU, MS. WANG! That said, I believe what truly made you so special to me was how you interacted with students outside of the classroom. Your vibrant spirit, the fact that the door is always open during lunch, the way you are so active in MESA, and your deliberate passion for STEM education make you so amazing. Earlier, I mentioned how difficult your course can be; however, this doesn’t do you justice. Despite assigning difficult work, you always give the option to redeem a student’s knowledge and grade, whether it’s through asking some questions during lunch, test revisions, or facilitating peer-to-peer education. You truly embody what I see as my ideal teacher, both in and out of the classroom. Finally, I want to thank you for being so willing to recommend me for a number of things. The first thing that you wrote a letter of recommendation for was a Summer Research Internship at UC Santa Cruz during the Summer of my Junior year. This internship unlocked so many doors for me, and I strongly believe it played a pivotal role in my acceptance to Harvard. More directly though, your immediate in my application to top colleges is something I could never thank you enough for. My admissions officer for both Harvard and Yale reached out to me via email and complimented my recommendations. For that, I thank you. Thank you so much for everything Ms. Wang. I am truly blessed to have had the privilege of meeting you.
