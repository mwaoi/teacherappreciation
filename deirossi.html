        <main>
            <p>Simply put, you are a great addition to SECA. Your friendly spirit is so welcoming to my peers and me. You truly feel like you are “one of us.” Not just in like the Timberwolf Pack way, but also as a friend of many of the students. You are genuinely such a positive person, and that makes you so fun to be around, even for students like me. I’ve heard countless times from my peers how much they enjoy your positivity. So, please keep being you, and please keep making kids smile. Aside from that, you have been a tremendous help in my academic journey. Though you just met me this year, your help in getting me that Student Representative position at the school district has opened so many doors for me. From representing 36000 SUSD students on the board, to connecting with trailblazers and policy makers in Stockton, to attending a National Youth Leadership Summit in Minnesota, I could go on and on about what this position has given me. I only have you to thank for that. So, thank you, Mr. Dei Rossi. Additionally, your constant support of the faculty here at SECA is what holds together such a strong union of teachers. The academic instruction at SECA, especially with the upperclassmen teachers, is what makes this school so special. The cohesion, synergy, and level of communication these teachers have at the upper level of SECA give Seniors the comfort to focus on their College/Career journey because they understand what Seniors go through while taking their courses. This level of understanding creates such a friendly environment that the senior class really needed during such a difficult college application season. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me and SECA, Mr. Dei Rossi. I anticipate you to only get better at your role as you get more comfortable leading our campus.

    Thank you, Mr. Dei. Rossi.
